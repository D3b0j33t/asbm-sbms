## 📊 Database Schema

The application utilizes a normalized PostgreSQL database schema through Supabase:

### Core Tables

- **students** - Comprehensive student profiles with academic metrics
  - Primary academic indicators: attendance, behavior_score, academic_score
  - Performance tracking: participation_score, leaderboard_points, cgpa

- **personality_traits** - Psychological profile data for each student
  - Five-factor model: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism

- **behavioral_incidents** - Documented behavioral events
  - Categorized by type, severity, and detailed descriptions

- **teaching_materials** - Educational resources with access controls
  - Metadata: name, description, file details
  - Access management: shared_with_all, shared_with_course

- **notifications** - System-wide messaging infrastructure
  - Targeted by recipient roles and IDs
  - Categorized by type and read status

- **course_cards** - Course information and metadata
  - Visual customization: color, thumbnail_url
  - Content organization: title, description, subject

### Relationships

- Students have personality traits (one-to-one)
- Students are associated with behavioral incidents (one-to-many)
- Courses contain teaching materials (one-to-many)
- Students have access to specific materials (many-to-many through student_materials)
- Users receive targeted notifications (one-to-many)
